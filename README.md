# Plan it
Plan it is a web application (PWA), created for tracking your things to do.

## Construction
Plan it consists of several different views:

- Home - summary of nearest three todo activities, you can also add new todo here. 
- List of all todos - a view that shows all todos with their names, descriptions, and dates, you can also manage all todos from here. 
- Settings - a view that gives the ability to change the user's display name, toggle dark mode and hide completed todos.
- Preview todo - a view that shows all information about specific todo(name, description, comments, deadline), you can also finish, edit or delete this todo here.
- Add todo - a view that gives the ability to add a new todo.
- Edit todo - a view that gives the ability to edit the existing todo.

## Technology stack
- React (+hooks)
- Redux
- Material UI
- React Router
- Reselect
- Redux Persist

## Personal insights
Plan it gave me a really quick lesson about Material UI and Material Design because this was my first meeting with it :D. Material UI is a really powerful tool for building application which looks good on various devices. I also build dark mode and learned how to apply it.
